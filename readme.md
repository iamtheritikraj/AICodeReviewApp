<h1>AI Code Review App</h1>
<p>The AI Code Review App is a backend service built using Java that allows users to log in via GitHub OAuth, retrieve their repositories, and review code files using AI models like ChatGPT or Claude. The application leverages GitHub's API to fetch repository information and file contents, which are then analyzed by AI models for code review. The results of the review are presented to the user in a concise and informative manner.</p>
